        <h1>Does the Gender Income Gap Expand in Areas Affected by Disaster?</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This paper examines the impact of the Great East Japan earthquake on the gender income gap in affected areas. Using data from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the population census, we find that women's average income in disaster-affected areas showed significant increases compared to other groups. However, men experienced more substantial gains in regular employment, while women saw limited gains in regular employment and decreases in non-regular employment. Our results suggest that the apparent increase in women's average income may be due to selection bias, and we propose the use of event study analysis using panel data to control for this bias.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Great East Japan earthquake, which occurred in March 2011, had a devastating impact on the affected areas. This paper examines the impact of the disaster on the gender income gap in these areas. We use data from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the population census to analyze the changes in income and employment status of men and women in the affected areas.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We use a difference-in-difference analysis to compare the changes in income and employment status of men and women in the affected areas with those in other areas. We also use a DID analysis on the population census data to examine the impact of the disaster on employment status and employment types.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that women's average income in disaster-affected areas showed significant increases compared to other groups. However, men experienced more substantial gains in regular employment, while women saw limited gains in regular employment and decreases in non-regular employment.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our results suggest that the apparent increase in women's average income may be due to selection bias. Women who were more likely to be in non-regular employment may have left the labor market after the disaster, leading to an increase in the average income of women who remained in the labor market. We propose the use of event study analysis using panel data to control for this bias.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, our study finds that the Great East Japan earthquake had a significant impact on the gender income gap in affected areas. While women's average income increased, men experienced more substantial gains in regular employment. However, our results also suggest that the apparent increase in women's average income may be due to selection bias. Further research is needed to control for this bias and to understand the real impact of the disaster on the gender income gap.</p>
