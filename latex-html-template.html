        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Kopi Luwak is a type of specialty coffee that is made from coffee beans that have passed through the digestive system of the Asian palm civet, a small mammal native to Indonesia. The unique production process of Kopi Luwak contributes to its high price, making it one of the world's most expensive types of coffee. This report examines the economics of Kopi Luwak, including the effects of supply and demand on its price.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This report uses a case study approach to analyze the economics of Kopi Luwak. We examine the production process of Kopi Luwak and its impact on the market, including the effects of supply and demand on the price of this specialty coffee.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The production process of Kopi Luwak is labor-intensive and rare, contributing to its high price. The demand for Kopi Luwak is high due to its unique flavor and exclusivity, while the supply is limited due to the unusual production process. This is an example of how supply and demand can impact the price of a product.</p>

        <table class="col-1-l col-2-c col-3-r borders-custom">
            <caption>Table 1: Supply and Demand of Kopi Luwak</caption>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thick">
                <th>Variable</th>
                <th>Value</th>
                <th>Effect on Price</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thin">
                <td>Supply</td>
                <td>Limited</td>
                <td>Increases price</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Demand</td>
                <td>High</td>
                <td>Increases price</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The market for Kopi Luwak can be characterized as a Veblen good, where the high price actually increases demand due to its exclusivity and prestige. This is an example of how the price of a product can affect its demand, rather than the other way around.</p>

        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
            <p>The relationship between price and demand can be modeled using the following equation:</p>
            \[
            Q = f(P)
            \]
            <p>Where Q is the quantity demanded and P is the price of the product.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the economics of Kopi Luwak is a complex and unique case study that highlights the effects of supply and demand on the price of a product. The high price of Kopi Luwak is due to its labor-intensive and rare production process, as well as its high demand due to its exclusivity and prestige.</p>
