            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Using microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census, the analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study highlights the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 had a devastating impact on the economy and society, particularly in the affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima. This study aims to investigate the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the differences in income and employment between men and women in the affected areas.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The study uses microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys (JGSS) and the Population Census. The JGSS provides yearly cross-sectional data, while the Population Census offers individual microdata for 1% of the population every five years. The analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to estimate the impact of the disaster on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results show that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The analysis also reveals that the number of female workers declined significantly, especially among non-regular workers, suggesting a selection bias.</p>

            <caption>Table 1: Employment Types by Gender in Fukushima Prefecture (2010)</caption>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thick">
                <th>Employment Type</th>
                <th>Male</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Non-regular Employee</td>
                <td>9.8%</td>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The study's findings suggest that the disaster had a significant impact on the gender income gap, particularly in the affected areas. The results highlight the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap. The study's findings have implications for policymakers and researchers seeking to develop effective post-disaster recovery strategies.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the impact of disasters on the gender income gap. The findings suggest that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups, while men experienced significant improvements in regular employment. The study highlights the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of disasters on the gender income gap.</p>
