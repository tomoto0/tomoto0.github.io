            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of earthquakes on the gender income gap in Kuchma Prefectures. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that the immediate effect of earthquakes on female incomes is negative, but in the longer term, female incomes surge compared to males. We explore possible explanations for this phenomenon, including government support and aid, women's empowerment initiatives, and changes in social norms.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, can have devastating effects on communities and economies. The impact of earthquakes on the gender income gap is a complex issue that has received limited attention in the literature. This study aims to assess the impact of earthquakes on the gender income gap in Kuchma Prefectures.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the causal effect of earthquakes on the gender income gap. Our model includes individual and year fixed effects to control for time-invariant individual characteristics and time-varying aggregate shocks.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> The difference-in-differences model can be specified as:</p>
            \[
            Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*Treatment_{it} + \beta_2*Post_{it} + \beta_3*Treatment_{it}*Post_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
            \]
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> The model includes individual and year fixed effects to control for time-invariant individual characteristics and time-varying aggregate shocks. The treatment effect is estimated as the difference-in-differences between the pre- and post-disaster periods.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that the immediate effect of earthquakes on female incomes is negative, but in the longer term, female incomes surge compared to males. We find that the treatment effect is significant and positive, indicating that the earthquake has a positive impact on female incomes in the longer term.</p>

            </tr>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the impact of earthquakes on the gender income gap is complex and dynamic. We explore possible explanations for the surge in female incomes in the longer term, including government support and aid, women's empowerment initiatives, and changes in social norms.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study contributes to the literature on the impact of natural disasters on the gender income gap. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the dynamic and complex effects of earthquakes on the gender income gap. Future research should aim to further explore the mechanisms underlying these effects and to develop policies that promote gender equality in the aftermath of natural disasters.</p>
