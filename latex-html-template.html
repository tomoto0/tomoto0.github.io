            <p>This study examines the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Using microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census, the analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study highlights the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 had a devastating impact on the country, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. This study examines the impact of the disaster on the gender income gap, focusing on the affected areas. The analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The study uses microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census. The analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to examine the impact of the disaster on the gender income gap. The sample is restricted to individuals aged 15 and over, and metropolitan areas are excluded from the control group.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results show that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The analysis also reveals that the disaster had a negative impact on women's employment status and employment types.</p>

        <table class="col-1-l col-2-c col-3-r borders-custom">
            <caption>Table 1: Employment Status and Employment Types by Gender</caption>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thick">
                <th>Gender</th>
                <th>Employment Status</th>
                <th>Employment Types</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thin">
                <td>Male</td>
                <td>2.1-2.6 percentage points increase</td>
                <td>Regular employment: significant improvement</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Female</td>
                <td>Small and insignificant increase</td>
                <td>Regular employment: limited gains</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The study highlights the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap. The analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The study concludes that the disaster had a negative impact on women's employment status and employment types. However, the apparent increase in women's income from cross-sectional data can be misleading due to selection bias. To truly understand the disaster's impact on the gender gap, we need to control for this bias, possibly using panel datasets and event study analyses.</p>
