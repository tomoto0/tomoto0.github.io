        <h1>Gender-Differentiated Labor Market Impacts of the 2011 Fukushima Disaster</h1>

        <div class="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on the labor market in Fukushima Prefecture, focusing on the gender-differentiated effects on employment status and income. Using data from the 2010 and 2015 Population Census, we find that the disaster led to a significant decline in non-regular employment among females, resulting in an increase in average income for women in the region. Our analysis also reveals that the disaster had a transformative impact on female labor market participation and employment status, with a shift towards regular employment. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the economic consequences of natural disasters and the need for targeted policies to support affected populations.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Fukushima disaster had a devastating impact on the labor market in Fukushima Prefecture, with significant effects on employment status and income. This study examines the gender-differentiated effects of the disaster on the labor market, using data from the 2010 and 2015 Population Census.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This study uses a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the impact of the disaster on employment status and income. The DID model is estimated separately for male and female workers, using data from the 2010 and 2015 Population Census.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results of the DID analysis reveal that the disaster had a significant impact on employment status and income in Fukushima Prefecture. The disaster led to a decline in non-regular employment among females, resulting in an increase in average income for women in the region. The results also show that the disaster had a transformative impact on female labor market participation and employment status, with a shift towards regular employment.</p>
