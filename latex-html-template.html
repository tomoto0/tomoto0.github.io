        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Agricultural development is a critical component of economic growth and poverty reduction in many developing countries. This report aims to analyze the economic impact of various factors on agricultural productivity and economic growth.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The analysis is based on a comprehensive review of existing literature and data from various sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results of the analysis show that agricultural productivity is positively correlated with economic growth, and that investments in agricultural development can have significant economic returns. The results also highlight the importance of addressing the challenges facing small-scale farmers, including limited access to credit and markets.</p>

                <td>Agricultural productivity growth rate</td>
                <td>5-10%</td>
                <td>FAO (2020)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Economic growth rate</td>
                <td>3-5%</td>
                <td>World Bank (2020)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The results of the analysis have important implications for policy makers and development practitioners. They highlight the need to invest in agricultural development and to address the challenges facing small-scale farmers. The results also underscore the importance of monitoring and evaluating the impact of agricultural development programs.</p>

        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
            <p>The economic impact of agricultural development can be modeled using the following equation:</p>
            \[
            Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon
            \]
            <p>Where Y is the economic growth rate, X is the agricultural productivity growth rate, and \(\epsilon\) is the error term.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the analysis highlights the importance of agricultural development for economic growth and poverty reduction. The results underscore the need to invest in agricultural development and to address the challenges facing small-scale farmers. The findings of this report can inform policy makers and development practitioners in their efforts to promote agricultural development and economic growth.</p>
