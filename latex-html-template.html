            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Using microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census, the analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study highlights the importance of considering selection bias and shock coping strategies when analyzing the impact of disasters on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 had a devastating impact on the economy and society. This study aims to investigate the effect of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the differences in income between men and women in areas affected by the disaster.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The study uses microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census. The analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to examine the impact of the disaster on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results show that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements.</p>

        <table class="col-1-l col-2-c col-3-r borders-custom">
            <caption>Table 1: Employment Types by Gender in Fukushima Prefecture Before the Disaster</caption>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thick">
                <th>Employment Type</th>
                <th>Male</th>
                <th>Female</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thin">
                <td>Regular Employment</td>
                <td>62.7%</td>
                <td>40.1%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Non-regular Employment</td>
                <td>37.3%</td>
                <td>59.9%</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The study highlights the importance of considering selection bias and shock coping strategies when analyzing the impact of disasters on the gender income gap. The results suggest that women's average income appeared to increase faster than men's during the recovery phase, despite men gaining more in regular employment. However, this apparent increase in women's income can be misleading due to selection bias.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The study concludes that disasters can have a significant impact on the gender income gap, with women being disproportionately affected in the short term. However, the apparent increase in women's income during the recovery phase can be misleading due to selection bias. Further research is needed to control for this bias and to better understand the long-term effects of disasters on the gender income gap.</p>
