            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima earthquake on the labor market and the gender gap in Japan. Using a combination of difference-in-differences and event study models, we find that the earthquake had a significant impact on the income gap between female and male workers. The results suggest that female workers experienced a larger decline in income compared to male workers after the earthquake. However, in the long term, female workers in Fukushima Prefecture experienced an increase in income due to migration to other prefectures and the influx of low-paying labor.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Fukushima earthquake had a significant impact on the labor market in Japan, particularly for female workers. This study examines the impact of the earthquake on the labor market and the gender gap in Japan, using a combination of difference-in-differences and event study models.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We use a combination of difference-in-differences and event study models to examine the impact of the earthquake on the labor market and the gender gap. The difference-in-differences model is used to estimate the impact of the earthquake on the income gap between female and male workers, while the event study model is used to examine the dynamic effects of the earthquake on the labor market.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> The difference-in-differences model is used to estimate the impact of the earthquake on the income gap between female and male workers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> The difference-in-differences model is specified as follows:</p>
            \[
            Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1*Female_{it} + \beta_2*Post_{it} + \beta_3*Female_{it}*Post_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
            \]
            <p>Where:</p>
            <p>- \(Y_{it}\) is the income of worker \(i\) at time \(t\)</p>
            <p>- \(Female_{it}\) is a dummy variable indicating whether the worker is female (1) or male (0)</p>
            <p>- \(Post_{it}\) is a dummy variable indicating whether the observation is after the earthquake (1) or before (0)</p>
            <p>- \(Female_{it}*Post_{it}\) is the interaction term between the female and post-earthquake dummies</p>
            <p>- \(\alpha_i\) is the individual fixed effect for worker \(i\)</p>
            <p>- \(\gamma_t\) is the time fixed effect for time \(t\)</p>
            <p>- \(\epsilon_{it}\) is the error term</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results of the difference-in-differences model suggest that the earthquake had a significant impact on the income gap between female and male workers. The results also suggest that female workers experienced a larger decline in income compared to male workers after the earthquake.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The results of this study suggest that the 2011 Fukushima earthquake had a significant impact on the labor market and the gender gap in Japan. The results also suggest that female workers experienced a larger decline in income compared to male workers after the earthquake. However, in the long term, female workers in Fukushima Prefecture experienced an increase in income due to migration to other prefectures and the influx of low-paying labor.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima earthquake on the labor market and the gender gap in Japan. The results suggest that the earthquake had a significant impact on the income gap between female and male workers, with female workers experiencing a larger decline in income compared to male workers after the earthquake. However, in the long term, female workers in Fukushima Prefecture experienced an increase in income due to migration to other prefectures and the influx of low-paying labor. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and researchers seeking to understand the impact of natural disasters on labor markets and the gender gap.</p>
