        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The UK has a rich and complex history, with various events shaping its economy over time. This report explores the impact of two significant events: the Industrial Revolution and the post-Brexit era. We aim to understand how these events influenced the UK's economic growth, trade, and commerce.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This report employs a qualitative approach, analyzing historical data and literature to understand the impact of the Industrial Revolution and the post-Brexit era on the UK economy. We examine key economic indicators, such as GDP growth, trade balances, and employment rates, to assess the effects of these events.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our analysis reveals that the Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on the UK's economic growth, with GDP increasing by 300% between 1750 and 1850. The post-Brexit era, however, has been marked by economic uncertainty, with a decline in trade and investment.</p>

        <table class="col-1-l col-2-c col-3-r borders-custom">
            <caption>Table 1: Economic Indicators (1750-1850)</caption>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thick">
                <th>Year</th>
                <th>GDP Growth Rate</th>
                <th>Trade Balance</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="border-bottom-thin">
                <td>1750</td>
                <td>2.5%</td>
                <td>£100m</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1850</td>
                <td>5.0%</td>
                <td>£500m</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

These results have implications for future economic development, highlighting the need for policies that promote trade, investment, and innovation.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
