            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on income by gender in Japan. Using a combination of econometric techniques, including regression analysis and propensity score matching, we analyze the short-term and long-term effects of the disaster on income by gender. Our results show that the disaster had a disproportionate impact on women's income compared to men's, and that the effects of the disaster on income by gender varied across different industries and occupations. We also find that social and cultural factors played a significant role in shaping the impact of the disaster on income by gender.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami was one of the most devastating natural disasters in Japanese history, resulting in significant economic and social impacts on affected communities. This study aims to examine the impact of the disaster on income by gender, using a combination of econometric techniques and data from national surveys and administrative records.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This study uses a combination of regression analysis and propensity score matching to estimate the causal effect of the disaster on income by gender. We use data from the Japanese government's surveys on employment, income, and poverty rates, as well as administrative data from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We also use case studies and qualitative research to gather more nuanced insights into the impact of the disaster on income by gender.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that the disaster had a disproportionate impact on women's income compared to men's, and that the effects of the disaster on income by gender varied across different industries and occupations. We also find that social and cultural factors played a significant role in shaping the impact of the disaster on income by gender.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the disaster had a significant impact on income by gender, with women's income being disproportionately affected. This is consistent with previous research on the impact of disasters on women's economic empowerment. Our results also highlight the importance of considering social and cultural factors in shaping the impact of disasters on income by gender.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study provides new insights into the impact of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on income by gender in Japan. Our findings suggest that the disaster had a significant impact on women's income compared to men's, and that social and cultural factors played a significant role in shaping the impact of the disaster on income by gender. Our results have implications for policymakers and practitioners working to support affected communities and promote women's economic empowerment in the aftermath of disasters.</p>
