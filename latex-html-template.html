            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima earthquake on female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) model, we find that the earthquake had a disproportionate impact on female workers, exacerbating existing gender disparities in the labor market. However, over the long term, female workers in Fukushima Prefecture have been able to recover and even gain ground in terms of income. We discuss the implications of these findings for policies aimed at supporting female workers in disaster-affected areas.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Fukushima earthquake had a devastating impact on the labor market in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Female workers were disproportionately affected, with many losing their jobs or experiencing reduced working hours. This study examines the impact of the earthquake on female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, using a difference-in-differences (DiD) model to estimate the treatment effect.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We use a panel dataset of individuals to analyze the changes in employment and income patterns among female workers in Fukushima Prefecture over time. We control for customer preferences as a potential confounding variable and use a DiD model to estimate the treatment effect.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> The DiD model can be used to estimate the treatment effect for different subgroups of female workers in Fukushima Prefecture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> By including interaction terms between the treatment variable and subgroup variables, we can estimate the treatment effect for each subgroup separately.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>We find that the earthquake had a disproportionate impact on female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, exacerbating existing gender disparities in the labor market. However, over the long term, female workers in Fukushima Prefecture have been able to recover and even gain ground in terms of income.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the earthquake had a disproportionate impact on female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, exacerbating existing gender disparities in the labor market. However, over the long term, female workers in Fukushima Prefecture have been able to recover and even gain ground in terms of income. We discuss the implications of these findings for policies aimed at supporting female workers in disaster-affected areas.</p>
