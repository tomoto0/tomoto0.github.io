            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Japan earthquake on the gender gap using event study analysis and econometric techniques. We employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) model and a regression discontinuity design (RDD) model to estimate the treatment effect of the earthquake on the gender gap. Our results show that the earthquake had a significant impact on the gender gap, particularly in areas with higher human development index (HDI) values. We also find that the treatment effect varies across different subgroups of the population, highlighting the importance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in the treatment effect.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Japan earthquake and tsunami had a devastating impact on the country's economy and society, including the gender gap. This study aims to examine the impact of the earthquake on the gender gap using event study analysis and econometric techniques.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We employ a DiD model and an RDD model to estimate the treatment effect of the earthquake on the gender gap. The DiD model compares the change in the gender gap in the affected areas (treatment group) to the change in the unaffected areas (control group) before and after the earthquake. The RDD model examines the impact of the earthquake on the gender gap by comparing the outcomes of individuals or areas that were just above and below a certain threshold (e.g., the earthquake's epicenter).</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> The DiD model can be represented as:</p>
            \[Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1T + \beta_2D + \beta_3(T \times D) + \epsilon\]
            <p>where \(Y\) is the outcome variable (gender gap), \(T\) is the treatment variable (affected areas), \(D\) is the time variable (before/after the earthquake), and \(\beta_3\) represents the treatment effect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> The RDD model can be represented as:</p>
            \[Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2T + \beta_3(X \times T) + \epsilon\]
            <p>where \(Y\) is the outcome variable (gender gap), \(X\) is the running variable (distance from the epicenter), \(T\) is the treatment variable (affected areas), and \(\beta_3\) represents the treatment effect.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that the earthquake had a significant impact on the gender gap, particularly in areas with higher HDI values. We also find that the treatment effect varies across different subgroups of the population, highlighting the importance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in the treatment effect.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the earthquake had a significant impact on the gender gap, particularly in areas with higher HDI values. The treatment effect varies across different subgroups of the population, highlighting the importance of accounting for unobserved heterogeneity in the treatment effect.</p>
