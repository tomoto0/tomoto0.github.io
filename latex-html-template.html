            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima quake on labor market outcomes using a difference-in-differences (DID) model and an event study model. The results suggest that the quake had a significant impact on labor market outcomes, particularly for female workers. The study also finds that the impact of the quake varied across different subgroups of workers, with workers in the treatment area experiencing a larger decline in labor market outcomes than workers in the control area.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Fukushima quake had a devastating impact on the labor market in Japan, particularly in the affected areas. This study aims to examine the impact of the quake on labor market outcomes using a DID model and an event study model. The study uses a panel dataset of individual workers from 2009 to 2018 to estimate the impact of the quake on labor market outcomes.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The study uses a DID model and an event study model to estimate the impact of the quake on labor market outcomes. The DID model is specified as follows:</p>
        <p>Yit = β0 + β1*Treatmentit + β2*Postit + β3*Treatmentit*Postit + γi + δt + εit</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <p>- Yit is the labor market outcome of interest (e.g., employment rate, hours worked, wages) for individual i at time t</p>
        <p>- Treatmentit is a dummy variable indicating whether the individual is from a treatment area (e.g., Fukushima prefecture) or a control area</p>
        <p>- Postit is a dummy variable indicating whether the observation is from the post-quake period (2011 and after) or the pre-quake period (before 2011)</p>
        <p>- Treatmentit*Postit is the interaction term between the treatment and post-quake dummies, capturing the differential effect of the quake on the treatment group</p>
        <p>- γi is an individual fixed effect, controlling for time-invariant individual characteristics</p>
        <p>- δt is a time fixed effect, controlling for common shocks and trends</p>
        <p>- εit is the error term</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results of the DID model suggest that the quake had a significant impact on labor market outcomes, particularly for female workers. The results also suggest that the impact of the quake varied across different subgroups of workers, with workers in the treatment area experiencing a larger decline in labor market outcomes than workers in the control area.</p>
