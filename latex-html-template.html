            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Using microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census, the analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study highlights the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 had a devastating impact on the country, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. This study aims to examine the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the effects of the earthquake on the labor market and income differences between men and women.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The study uses microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census to analyze the impact of the disaster on the labor market and income differences between men and women. The analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to compare the outcomes between the treatment and control groups.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results show that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study also finds that the number of female workers decreased significantly, especially among non-regular workers, suggesting a selection bias.</p>

                <td>7.9%</td>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The study's findings suggest that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market and income differences between men and women. The results highlight the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap. The study's findings have implications for policymakers and researchers seeking to understand the long-term effects of disasters on the labor market and income differences between men and women.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the study finds that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market and income differences between men and women. The results highlight the importance of considering the selection bias and shock coping strategies in understanding the disaster's impact on the gender income gap. The study's findings have implications for policymakers and researchers seeking to understand the long-term effects of disasters on the labor market and income differences between men and women.</p>
