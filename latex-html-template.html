            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the Japan earthquake on income gap in affected areas using an event study methodology. We employ a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach with fixed effects for year and individual to estimate the treatment effect. Our results show that the earthquake had a significant impact on income gap in affected areas, with a decrease in income gap in the post-earthquake period. We also find that the treatment effect varies over time, with a larger impact in the immediate post-earthquake period.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Japan earthquake had a devastating impact on the country's economy, particularly in affected areas. This study aims to examine the impact of the earthquake on income gap in affected areas using an event study methodology.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We employ a DiD approach with fixed effects for year and individual to estimate the treatment effect. Our model is specified as follows:</p>
        <p>ln(Yit) = β0 + β1Dit + β2Tt + β3DiTt + αi + γt + εit</p>
        <p>where ln(Yit) is the log of income gap in area i at time t, Dit is a dummy variable for earthquake-affected area, Tt is a dummy variable for time period, DiTt is an interaction term between Dit and Tt, αi is an individual fixed effect for area i, γt is a year fixed effect for time period t, and εit is an error term.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that the earthquake had a significant impact on income gap in affected areas, with a decrease in income gap in the post-earthquake period. We also find that the treatment effect varies over time, with a larger impact in the immediate post-earthquake period.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our results suggest that the earthquake had a significant impact on income gap in affected areas. The decrease in income gap in the post-earthquake period may be due to the government's disaster response and recovery efforts. However, the treatment effect varies over time, with a larger impact in the immediate post-earthquake period. This may be due to the fact that the government's response efforts were more effective in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study examines the impact of the Japan earthquake on income gap in affected areas using an event study methodology. Our results show that the earthquake had a significant impact on income gap in affected areas, with a decrease in income gap in the post-earthquake period. We also find that the treatment effect varies over time, with a larger impact in the immediate post-earthquake period. These findings have important implications for disaster response and recovery efforts.</p>
