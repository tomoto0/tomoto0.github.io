        <h1>Does the Gender Income Gap Expand in Areas Affected by Disasters?</h1>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Using microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys and the Population Census, the analysis reveals that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study highlights the importance of considering selection bias and shock coping strategies when analyzing the impact of disasters on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 had a devastating impact on the economy and society, particularly in the affected prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima. This study aims to investigate the impact of disasters on the gender income gap, focusing on the differences in income between men and women in disaster-affected areas.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The study uses microdatasets from the Japanese General Social Surveys (JGSS) and the Population Census. The JGSS provides yearly cross-sectional data, while the Population Census provides individual microdata for 1% of the population every five years. The study employs a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to analyze the impact of the disaster on the gender income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results show that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups. However, women saw limited gains in regular employment, while men experienced significant improvements. The study also finds that the number of female workers declined significantly, especially among non-regular workers, suggesting a selection bias where lower-paid female workers left the labor market after the disaster.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The study's findings suggest that the impact of disasters on the gender income gap is complex and multifaceted. The results highlight the importance of considering selection bias and shock coping strategies when analyzing the impact of disasters on the gender income gap. The study also emphasizes the need for policymakers to develop effective post-disaster recovery strategies that address the specific needs of women and men in disaster-affected areas.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the impact of disasters on the gender income gap. The findings suggest that women's average income in disaster-affected areas decreased significantly compared to other groups, while men experienced significant improvements in regular employment. The study highlights the importance of considering selection bias and shock coping strategies when analyzing the impact of disasters on the gender income gap. Future research should aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term effects of disasters on the gender income gap.</p>
