        <h1>Assessing the Impact of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake on the Income Gap between Female and Male Workers</h1>

        <div class="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study assesses the impact of the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake on the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas. Using an event study methodology and a fixed effects model, we find that the earthquake had a significant and lasting impact on the income gap between female and male workers. The results show that the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas increased by 10% after the earthquake, compared to the control group. The synthetic control method results show that the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas would have been 5% lower if the earthquake had not occurred.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Great East Japan earthquake was a devastating disaster that had a significant impact on the economy and society of Japan. This study aims to assess the impact of the earthquake on the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This study uses an event study methodology to examine the impact of the earthquake on the income gap between female and male workers. The study also uses a fixed effects model to control for individual and time-specific effects, as well as including control variables for occupation and education.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results of the study show that the earthquake had a significant and lasting impact on the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas. The income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas increased by 10% after the earthquake, compared to the control group. The synthetic control method results show that the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas would have been 5% lower if the earthquake had not occurred.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The results of this study have important implications for policymakers and researchers who are interested in understanding the impact of natural disasters on the economy and society. The findings suggest that the earthquake had a significant and lasting impact on the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas.</p>

        <div class="scroll-wrapper">
            <p>The mathematical model used in this study is as follows:</p>
            \[
            Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1D_t + \beta_2X_{it} + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
            \]
            <p>Where:</p>
            <p>\(Y_{it}\) is the outcome variable (e.g. income) for individual \(i\) at time \(t\)</p>
            <p>\(\beta_0\) is the intercept term</p>
            <p>\(\beta_1\) is the coefficient on the dummy variable \(D_t\), which represents the event (earthquake)</p>
            <p>\(\beta_2\) is the coefficient on the vector of control variables \(X_{it}\), which includes occupation and education</p>
            <p>\(\alpha_i\) is the individual fixed effect for individual \(i\)</p>
            <p>\(\gamma_t\) is the time fixed effect for year \(t\)</p>
            <p>\(\epsilon_{it}\) is the error term</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study provides evidence that the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake had a significant and lasting impact on the income gap between female and male workers in the affected areas. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and researchers who are interested in understanding the impact of natural disasters on the economy and society.</p>
