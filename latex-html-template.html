            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on women's labor market outcomes in Japan using a difference-in-differences (DiD) methodology and event study models. The results show that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market outcomes of female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, particularly in the short term. However, in the longer term, the average income of female workers increased relative to male workers. The study also finds that the disaster led to an increase in female labor force participation and a shift towards higher-paying jobs.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Fukushima disaster was a triple disaster that consisted of an earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear explosion. The disaster had a significant impact on the labor market outcomes of women in Fukushima Prefecture, particularly in the short term. This study aims to examine the impact of the disaster on women's labor market outcomes in Japan using a DiD methodology and event study models.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This study uses a DiD methodology to estimate the impact of the disaster on women's labor market outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture. The treatment group consists of female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, while the control group consists of female workers in other prefectures. The study also uses event study models to analyze the dynamics of the impact over time.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results show that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market outcomes of female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, particularly in the short term. However, in the longer term, the average income of female workers increased relative to male workers. The study also finds that the disaster led to an increase in female labor force participation and a shift towards higher-paying jobs.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The results of this study suggest that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market outcomes of female workers in Fukushima Prefecture. However, in the longer term, the average income of female workers increased relative to male workers. This may be due to an increase in female labor force participation and a shift towards higher-paying jobs.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Fukushima disaster on women's labor market outcomes in Japan using a DiD methodology and event study models. The results show that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market outcomes of female workers in Fukushima Prefecture, particularly in the short term.
