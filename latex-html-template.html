        <h1>Gender-Differentiated Labor Market Impacts of the 2011 Fukushima Disaster</h1>

        <div class="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the gender-differentiated labor market impacts of the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Using population census data from 2010 and 2015, we analyze the changes in employment patterns and occupational shifts in Fukushima Prefecture. Our results show that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market, with a decline in non-regular employment and an increase in regular employment for women. We also find that the disaster led to a significant decrease in female non-regular workers, which may have contributed to an increase in average income for women in the region.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Fukushima disaster had a significant impact on the labor market in Fukushima Prefecture. This study aims to examine the gender-differentiated labor market impacts of the disaster, focusing on changes in employment patterns and occupational shifts.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>This study uses population census data from 2010 and 2015 to analyze the changes in employment patterns and occupational shifts in Fukushima Prefecture. We employ a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the impact of the disaster on employment status.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that the disaster had a significant impact on the labor market, with a decline in non-regular employment and an increase in regular employment for women. We also find that the disaster led to a significant decrease in female non-regular workers, which may have contributed to an increase in average income for women in the region.</p>
