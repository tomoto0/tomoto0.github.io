        <h1>Assessing the Impact of the Fukushima Disaster on the Income Gap between Male and Female Workers</h1>

        <div class="abstract">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the Fukushima disaster on the income gap between male and female workers in Fukushima Prefecture. Using a difference-in-differences (DiD) model and event study models, we find that the disaster had a disproportionate impact on female workers, leading to a decrease in their average income initially. However, as non-regular workers left the workforce, the average income of the remaining female workers increased. We also find that the disaster led to changes in the types of industries and occupations that female workers were employed in, with a shift towards higher-paying industries. Our results suggest that the disaster had a complex impact on the income gap between male and female workers, and that policies aimed at supporting female workers in the affected areas may be necessary to mitigate the negative effects of the disaster.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Fukushima disaster had a significant impact on the local economy of Fukushima Prefecture, with many workers affected by the disaster. This study examines the impact of the disaster on the income gap between male and female workers in Fukushima Prefecture. We use a difference-in-differences (DiD) model and event study models to estimate the impact of the disaster on the income gap.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We use a DiD model to estimate the impact of the disaster on the income gap between male and female workers. The model controls for individual fixed effects and year-time fixed effects. We also use event study models to examine the impact of the disaster on the income gap over time.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> The DiD model can be used to estimate the impact of the disaster on the income gap between male and female workers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> The DiD model is a widely used method for estimating the impact of a treatment on an outcome variable. In this case, the treatment is the disaster, and the outcome variable is the income gap between male and female workers. By controlling for individual fixed effects and year-time fixed effects, we can isolate the impact of the disaster on the income gap.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results show that the disaster had a disproportionate impact on female workers, leading to a decrease in their average income initially. However, as non-regular workers left the workforce, the average income of the remaining female workers increased. We also find that the disaster led to changes in the types of industries and occupations that female workers were employed in, with a shift towards higher-paying industries.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our results suggest that the disaster had a complex impact on the income gap between male and female workers. The initial decrease in female workers' income was likely due to the loss of non-regular workers, who were disproportionately female. However, as the remaining female workers shifted towards higher-paying industries, their average income increased. These findings have implications for policies aimed at supporting female workers in the affected areas.</p>

            <p>Long equation example:</p>
            \[
            Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times Treatment_i + \beta_2 \times Post_i + \beta_3 \times Treatment_i \times Post_i + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \epsilon_{it}
            \]
        </div>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, our study finds that the Fukushima disaster had a disproportionate impact on female workers, leading to a decrease in their average income initially. However, as non-regular workers left the workforce, the average income of the remaining female workers increased. Our results suggest that policies aimed at supporting female workers in the affected areas may be necessary to mitigate the negative effects of the disaster.</p>
