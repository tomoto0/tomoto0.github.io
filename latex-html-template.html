            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study aims to investigate the impact of natural disasters on the income gap between females and males using the Event Study approach. The analysis will examine the relationship between various independent variables, including occupation, education, female, married, and disaster area, and the dependent variable, income. The study will also consider the use of econometric techniques, such as instrumental variables, propensity score matching, or difference-in-differences, to control for potential confounding variables. The findings of this study will provide insights into the potential policy implications of reducing the income gap between females and males in the aftermath of a natural disaster.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Natural disasters have been shown to have a significant impact on the economy and society, particularly in terms of the income gap between females and males. This study aims to investigate the impact of natural disasters on the income gap between females and males using the Event Study approach. The analysis will examine the relationship between various independent variables, including occupation, education, female, married, and disaster area, and the dependent variable, income.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>The Event Study approach will be used to analyze the impact of natural disasters on the income gap between females and males. The analysis will involve defining the event window and collecting data on the dependent variable (income) for a sample of individuals before and after the event. The model will be estimated using a regression analysis and calculating the abnormal return or effect of the event on the dependent variable. Econometric techniques, such as instrumental variables, propensity score matching, or difference-in-differences, will be considered to control for potential confounding variables.</p>

        <div class="theorem">
            <p><strong>Theorem 1:</strong> The Event Study approach can be used to analyze the impact of natural disasters on the income gap between females and males.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            <p><strong>Proof:</strong> The Event Study approach involves defining the event window and collecting data on the dependent variable (income) for a sample of individuals before and after the event.

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>The results of the analysis will provide insights into the impact of natural disasters on the income gap between females and males. The findings will be presented in the form of tables and figures, and will include the estimated coefficients of the independent variables and the abnormal return or effect of the event on the dependent variable.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>The findings of this study will provide insights into the potential policy implications of reducing the income gap between females and males in the aftermath of a natural disaster. The results will be discussed in the context of the existing literature on the topic, and will include recommendations for future research.</p>
