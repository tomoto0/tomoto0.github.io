            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This study examines the impact of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on the gender gap in income in Fukushima Prefecture. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we compare the change in income for men and women in Fukushima Prefecture before and after the disaster, relative to a control group of men and women in a neighboring prefecture that was not affected by the disaster. Our results suggest that the disaster exacerbated the existing gender gap in income in Fukushima Prefecture, with women experiencing a disproportionate decline in income and employment outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings for policymakers and highlight the need for targeted interventions to support vulnerable populations, particularly women, in the aftermath of natural disasters.</p>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>The 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami had a devastating impact on Fukushima Prefecture, causing widespread destruction and displacement. Women, in particular, were disproportionately affected by the disaster, with many losing their livelihoods and facing significant challenges in accessing basic necessities like healthcare and education. This study aims to examine the impact of the disaster on the gender gap in income in Fukushima Prefecture, using a difference-in-differences approach.</p>

        <h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
        <p>We use data from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Labour Force Survey to obtain information on income and employment outcomes for men and women in Fukushima Prefecture and a control group of men and women in a neighboring prefecture that was not affected by the disaster. We employ a difference-in-differences approach to compare the change in income for men and women in Fukushima Prefecture before and after the disaster, relative to the control group.</p>

        <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
        <p>Our results suggest that the disaster exacerbated the existing gender gap in income in Fukushima Prefecture, with women experiencing a disproportionate decline in income and employment outcomes. We find that the disaster had a significant and lasting impact on the gender gap in income, with women's income declining by 15% in the short-term and 20% in the long-term, relative to men's income.</p>

        <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our findings suggest that the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami had a disproportionate impact on women's income and employment outcomes in Fukushima Prefecture. We discuss the implications of our findings for policymakers and highlight the need for targeted interventions to support vulnerable populations, particularly women, in the aftermath of natural disasters.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This study provides new insights into the impact of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami on the gender gap in income in Fukushima Prefecture. Our findings suggest that the disaster exacerbated the existing gender gap in income, with women experiencing a disproportionate decline in income and employment outcomes. We hope that our study will inform policymakers and contribute to the development of effective policies to support vulnerable populations, particularly women, in the aftermath of natural disasters.</p>
